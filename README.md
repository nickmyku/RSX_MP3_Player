RSX_MP3_Player
==============

code created in the quest to build a more perfect car/touch based MP3 player

full project write up avalible on my blog - [Electric Campfire](http://electriccampfire.info/2013/12/08/rsx-in-dash-computer/)

code was written in an outdated version of [Processing](https://www.processing.org/) which used an even more outdated version of Java. It only really works on the sterile(un-networked) computer that runs this code because it appears that java has dropped support of several functions/libraries I used.

a pre-compiled Windows 7 32-bit executable can be found in the application.windows32 folder, it is called RSX_MP3_Player.exe
